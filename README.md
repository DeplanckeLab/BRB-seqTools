# BRB-seq Tools
A suite of tools for the pre-processing of BRB-seq data (bulk RNA-seq)

### Download Software

BRB-seq command-line tools are provided as a single executable jar file. 
The .jar file contains all required materials and can be run on any terminal.
For the tools to run properly, you must have Java 1.8 installed. 

To check your java version by open your terminal application and run the following command:

```bash
java -version
```

If the output looks something like java version "1.8.x", you are good to go. 
If not, you may need to update your version; see the [Oracle Java website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/) to download the latest JRE (for users) or JDK (for developers).

The software relies on [Picard Tools](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/)
