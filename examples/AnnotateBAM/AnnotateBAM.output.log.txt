BRBSeqTools 1.1 [AnnotateBAM]

Output folder does not exist. Creating it
A barcode mapping file was specified, barcodes will be annotated as in R1 (with mismatch correction) or 'Unknown' if not mapping to any barcode.
Nb Allowed Diff = 1
A GTF file was specified using the '-gtf' option. Output annotated BAM will contain annotated gene with 'CO' TAG
Stranded = YES
Barcode Pattern = BU
ChunkSize = 1000000 i.e. no more than 1000000 reads will be stored in RAM.
No folder for temporary generated files is specified, using output folder as default: "AnnotateBAM/". You can specify a temporary folder by using the '-t' option.
Config: B1 contains 4 barcodes: [ GACGGG GTCAAG ATGTAA CCACGC ]
Config: B1 length [#nucleotides] = 6

Analyzing barcode Pattern...
According to barcode pattern, reads of R1 FastQ file should contain 20 characters.

Reading GTF file provided: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.90.gtf.gz
1199851 'exons' are annotating 58302 unique genes in the provided GTF file. In total 58302 'gene' annotations are found in the GTF file.
